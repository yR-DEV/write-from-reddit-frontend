## FRONTEND REPO: https://github.com/yR-DEV/write-from-reddit-frontend

# What is it and why build it?
WriteFromReddit is a fullstack application that allows users to Write to, Save, Edit, and Delete responses to writing prompts web-scraped from the popular subreddit `/r/WritingPrompts`.
- As I become increasingly surrounded by code and the logical mindset for the majority of my day, I began to miss the creative part of myself that I have always seriously respected and deeply appreciated. 

        I KNOW that I need a creative outlet to satisfy my urges of complete creation. This application is my solution to that problem.
- This application allows me the freedom of writing to a top voted writing prompt on reddit and save it, along with my response, in one place. Although there is an option to write your own or free write, sometimes the difficulty in starting something new without an idea can consume a lot of time. This application helps out with it. 


### **TL;DR** - Satisfy your creative writing urges and inability to start writing with an application that web scrapes /r/WritingPrompts and presents you with a platform to respond, save, edit, and delete
